## About

The SRG Analytics library for iOS makes it easy to add usage tracking information to your applications, following the SRG SSR standards.

Measurements are based on events emitted by the application, and collected by TagCommander and NetMetrix. Currently, the following kinds of events are supported

 * View events: Appearance of views (page views), which makes it possible to track which content is seen by users.
 * Hidden events: Custom events which can be used for measuresement of application functionalities.
 * Media playback events: Measurements for audio and video consumption in conjunction with our [SRG Media Player library](https://github.com/SRGSSR/SRGMediaPlayer-iOS).

Moreover, if you are retrieving your data using our [SRG Data Provider library](https://github.com/SRGSSR/srgdataprovider-ios), a bridge framework is also provided so that analytics received from the service are transparently forwarded to the SRG Analytics library.
 
## Compatibility

The library is suitable for applications running on iOS 8 and above. The project is meant to be opened with the latest Xcode version (currently Xcode 8).

## Installation

The library can be added to a project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)  by adding the following dependency to your `Cartfile`:
    
```
github "SRGSSR/srganalytics-ios"
```

Then run `carthage update --platform iOS` to update the dependencies. You will need to manually add one or several of the `.framework`s generated in the `Carthage/Build/iOS` folder to your project, depending on your needs:

* If you need analytics only, add the following frameworks to your project:
  * `libextobjc`: A utility framework.
  * `MAKVONotificationCenter`: A safe KVO framework.
  * `SRGAnalytics`: The main analytics framework.
  * `SRGLogger`: The framework used for internal logging.
  * `TCCore`: Core TagCommander framework.
  * `TCSDK`: TagCommander SDK framework.
* If you use our [SRG Media Player library](https://github.com/SRGSSR/SRGMediaPlayer-iOS) and want media consumption tracking as well, add the following frameworks to your project:
  * `libextobjc`: A utility framework.
  * `MAKVONotificationCenter`: A safe KVO framework.
  * `SRGAnalytics`: The main analytics framework.
  * `SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer`: The media player analytics companion framework.
  * `SRGLogger`: The framework used for internal logging.
  * `TCCore`: Core TagCommander framework.
  * `TCSDK`: TagCommander SDK framework.
* If you use our [SRG Data Provider library](https://github.com/SRGSSR/srgdataprovider-ios) to retrieve data, add the following frameworks to your project:
  * `libextobjc`: A utility framework.
  * `MAKVONotificationCenter`: A safe KVO framework.
  * `Mantle`:  The framework used to parse the data.
  * `SRGAnalytics`: The main analytics framework.
  * `SRGAnalytics_DataProvider`: The data provider analytics companion framework.
  * `SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer`: The media player analytics companion framework.
  * `SRGLogger`: The framework used for internal logging.
  * `SRGMediaPlayer`: The media player framework (if not already in your project).
  * `TCCore`: Core TagCommander framework.
  * `TCSDK`: TagCommander SDK framework.

## Usage

When you want to use classes or functions provided by the library in your code, you must import it from your source files first.

### Usage from Objective-C source files

Import the global header files using:

```objective-c
#import <SRGAnalytics/SRGAnalytics.h>	                            // For SRGAnalytics.framework
#import <SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer/SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer.h>       // For SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer.framework
#import <SRGAnalytics_DataProvider/SRGAnalytics_DataProvider.h>     // For SRGAnalytics_DataProvider.framework
```

or directly import the modules themselves:

```objective-c
@import SRGAnalytics;                    // For SRGAnalytics.framework
@import SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer;        // For SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer.framework
@import SRGAnalytics_DataProvider;		 // For SRGAnalytics_DataProvider.framework
```

### Usage from Swift source files

Import the modules where needed:

```swift
import SRGAnalytics                     // For SRGAnalytics.framework
import SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer         // For SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer.framework
import SRGAnalytics_DataProvider        // For SRGAnalytics_DataProvider.framework
```

### Working with the library

To learn about how the library can be used, have a look at the [getting started guide](Documentation/Getting-started.md).

### Logging

The library internally uses the [SRG Logger](https://github.com/SRGSSR/srglogger-ios) library for logging, with the following subsystems:

* `ch.srgssr.analytics` for `SRGAnalytics.framework` events.
* `ch.srgssr.analytics.mediaplayer` for `SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer.framework` events.
* `ch.srgssr.analytics.dataprovider` for `SRGAnalytics_DataProvider.framework` events.

This logger either automatically integrates with your own logger, or can be easily integrated with it. Refer to the SRG Logger documentation for more information.
