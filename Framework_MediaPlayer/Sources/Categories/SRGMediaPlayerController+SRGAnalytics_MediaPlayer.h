/**
 *  Streaming measurement additions to SRGAnalytics. The SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer framework is an optional SRGAnalytics
 *  companion framework which can be used to easily measure audio and video consumption in applications powered by 
 *  the SRG MediaPlayer library. If you need to implement streaming measurements for other players, use an instance of
 *  `SRGAnalyticsStreamTracker`.
 *
 *  When playing a media, two levels of analytics information (labels) are consolidated:
 *    - Labels associated with the content URL being played.
 *    - Labels associated with segment being played, which are merged and might override content URL labels.
 *
 *  The SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer framework automatically takes care of content and segment playback tracking, and 
 *  supplies mechanisms to add your custom measurement labels to stream events if needed.
 *
 *  ## Usage
 *
 *  Simply add `SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer.framework` to your project (which should already contain the main
 *  `SRGAnalytics.framework` as well as `SRGMediaPlayer.framework` as dependencies).
 *
 *  The tracker itself must have been started before any measurements can take place (@see `SRGAnalyticsTracker`).
 * 
 *  By default, provided a tracker has been started, all SRG MediaPlayer controllers are automatically tracked without any
 *  additional work. You can disable this behavior by setting the `SRGMediaPlayerController` `tracked` property to `NO`.
 *
 *  By default, standard SRG playback information (playhead position, type of event, etc.) is sent in stream events.
 *  To supply additional measurement information (e.g. title or duration), you must use custom labels.
 *
 *  ## Additional measurement labels
 *
 *  You can supply additional custom measurement labels with stream events sent from your application. These labels
 *  are provided through `SRGAnalyticsStreamLabels` instances whose properties can be set depending on which information
 *  is needed.
 *
 *  Custom information can be added to both content and segment labels. When playing a segment, its labels are merged
 *  with labels associated with the content, overriding existing keys. You can take advantage of this behavior to add
 *  segment information on top of content labels.
 *  
 *  ### Labels associated with the content
 *
 *  Labels associated with a media being played can be supplied when starting playback, using one of the plaback
 *  methods made available below. 
 *
 *  ### Labels associated with a segment
 *
 *  To supply labels for a segment, have your segment model class conform to the `SRGAnalyticsSegment` protocol instead 
 *  of `SRGSegment`, and implement the required `srg_analyticsLabels` method.
