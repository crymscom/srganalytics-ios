/**
 *  View controllers whose usage must be tracked should conform to the `SRGAnalyticsViewTracking` protocol, which
 *  describes the data to send with such events. The only method required by this protocol is `srg_pageViewTitle`, 
 *  which provides the name to be used for the view events.
 *
 *  By default, if a view controller conforms to the `SRGAnalyticsViewTracking` protocol, a page view event will
 *  automatically be sent when it is presented for the first time (i.e. when `-viewDidAppear:` is called for
 *  the first time). In addition, a page view event will be automatically sent every time the application returns
 *  from background while the view controller is visible.
 *
 *  If you want to control when page view events are sent, however, you can implement the optional `srg_isTrackedAutomatically`
 *  method to return `NO`, disabling the mechanisms described above. In this case you are responsible of calling the
 *  `-[UIViewController trackPageView]` method appropriately when you want the measurement events to be recorded. This
 *  approach is useful when the labels are not available at the time `-viewDidAppear:` is called, e.g. if they are 
 *  retrieved from a web service request started when the view controller gets displayed.
 *
 *  If you prefer, you can also perform page view tracking using the corresponding methods available from
 *  `SRGAnalyticsTracker`.

 *  @discussion Automatic apparition tracking is considered only the first time a view controller is displayed. If

 *              no page view will be automatically sent afterwards. For this reason, it is recommended that the value
 *              returned by `srg_trackedAutomatically` should never be dynamic: Either return `YES` or `NO` depending
 *              on which kind of tracking you need.
