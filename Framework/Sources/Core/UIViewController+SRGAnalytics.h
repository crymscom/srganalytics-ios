/**
 *  View controllers whose use must be tracked by TagCommander and NetMetrix view events must conform to the
 *  `SRGAnalyticsViewTracking` protocol, which describes the data to send with such events. The only method
 *  required by this protocol is `srg_pageViewTitle`, which provides the name to be used for the view events.
 *
 *  Optional methods can be implemented to provide more information and custom measurement information (labels).
 *
 *  By default, if a view controller conforms to the `SRGAnalyticsViewTracking` protocol, a view event will
 *  automatically be sent when its `-viewDidAppear:` method is called or when the application returns from
 *  background while the view controller is visible. 
 *
 *  If you want to control when such events are sent, however, you can implement the optional `trackedAutomatically`
 *  property to return `NO`, disabling the mechanisms described above. In such cases, you are responsible of calling the
 *  `-[UIViewController trackPageView]` method appropriately when you want the measurement event to be recorded. This 
 *  approach is useful when the labels are not available at the time `-viewDidAppear:` is called, e.g. if they are 
 *  retrieved from a web service request started when the view controller gets displayed.
