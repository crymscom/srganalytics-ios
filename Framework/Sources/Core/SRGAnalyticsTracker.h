/**
 *  The analytics tracker is a singleton instance responsible of tracking usage of an application, sending measurements
 *  to TagCommander, comScore and NetMetrix. The usage data is simply a collection of key-values (both strings), named
 *  labels, which can then be used by data analysts in studies and reports.
 *
 *  The analytics tracker implementation follows the SRG SSRG guidelines for application measurements (mostly label name
 *  conventions) and is therefore only intended for use by applications produced under the SRG SSR umbrella.
 *
 *  ## Measurements
 *
 *  The SRG Analytics library supports three kinds of measurements:
 *    - View events: Appearance of views (page views), which makes it possible to track which content is seen by users.
 *    - Hidden events: Custom events which can be used for measuresement of application functionalities.
 *    - Stream playback events: Measurements for audio and video consumption.
 *
 *  For all kinds of measurements, required information must be provided through mandatory parameters, and optional
 *  labels can be provided through an optional labels object. In all cases, mandatory and optional information is
 *  transparently routed to the analytics services.
 *
 *  ## Usage
 *
 *  Using SRGAnalytics in your application is intended to be as easy as possible. Note that since the analytics tracker is
 *  a singleton, you cannot currently perform measurements related to several business units within a single application.
 *
 *  To track application usage:
 *
 *  1. Start the tracker early in your application lifecycle, for example in your application delegate
 *     `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` implementation, by calling the `-startWithConfiguration:` method. 
 *     This method expect a single configuration object containing all analytics setup information.
 *  1. To track page views related to view controllers, have them conform to the `SRGAnalyticsViewTracking` protocol.
 *     View controllers conforming to this protocol are automatically tracked by default, but this behavior can be
 *     tailored to your needs, especially if the time at which the measurement is made (when the view appears) is 
 *     inappropriate. Please refer to the `SRGAnalyticsViewTracking` documentation for more information. If your
 *     application uses plain views (not view controllers) which must be tracked as well, you can still perform
 *     manual tracking via the `-[SRGAnalyticsTracker trackPageViewWithTitle:levels:labels:fromPushNotification:]`
 *     method.
 *  1. When you need to track specific functionalities in your application (e.g. the use of some interface button
 *     or of some feature of your application), send a hidden event using one of the `-trackHiddenEvent...` methods
 *     available from `SRGAnalyticsTracker`.
 *  1. If you need to track media playback using SRG MediaPlayer, you must add the SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer subframework
 *     to your project (@see `SRGMediaPlayerController+SRGAnalytics_MediaPlayer.h` for more information). You are 
 *     still responsible of providing most metadata associated with playback (e.g. title or duration of what is 
 *     being played) when calling one of the playback methods provided by this subframework.
 *  1. If medias you play are retrieved using our SRG DataProvider library, you must add the SRGAnalytics_DataProvider
 *     subframework to your project as well (@see `SRGMediaPlayerController+SRGAnalytics_DataProvider.h` for more 
 *     information). In this case, all mandatory stream measurement metadata will be automatically provided when
 *     playing the content through one of the playback methods provided in this subframework.
 *
 *  You can also perform manual stream playback tracking when your player implementation does not rely on SRG MediaPlayer,
 *  @see `SRGAnalyticsStreamTracker` for more information.
